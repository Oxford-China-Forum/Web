				        motivated me to join OCF. First, OCF and its Individual Event program will allow us to establish
				        potentially the first ever China-focused student academic society in University of Oxford. It will
				        provide great opportunities for students and academics to gain deeper insights and understanding into
				        China as well as providing them with a networking and communication platform. Secondly, having studied
				        abroad for years, I have long wanted to present to the world a more accurate and authentic image of
				        China and I strongly believe that with the help of platforms such as OCF and my excellent colleagues who
				        share similar ambitions, we will be able to achieve this goal together.</p>

              <p>I am Yuqing Long, currently a Master student reading Statistics in the Jesus College. I am one of the
                panel directors for the OCF2020 education panel. I have run an education start-up a few years ago, and I
                am intrigued by K12 education in general. Through my experience in running the business and teaching, I
                realized the inefficiency and compromises that traditional education and online education have to make.
                I want to advocate and participate, through OCF 2020, in the discussion of education reform and AI’s
                role in future education. In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, EDM and video games. ?</p>
